                <h2>Hi, I'm Dalin!</h2>
                <h3>
                    I am a Data and Cybersecurity semi-pro eager to learn new technologies, master my skillset, and solve big problems.
                </h3>
                <h4>
                    Using a new found love for the Russian language, I took massive action in owning my learning and following my passion for technology.
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Quickly entering the workforce, I jumped into a Security Analyst role at Abnormal Security. I quickly came up to speed on remediating email attacks and began to dissect the Cybersecurity AI industry. At the heart of this ground breaking technology was data. I began developing my data coding skills, beginning with SQL and eventually transitioning into Python. This role led me down a path where I would be able to use, interact with, and analyze data. After starting a Quality Assurance role at Abnormal Security, I quickly moved into a Senior Analyst role at Goldman Sachs, and sought out more opportunities to get closer to data in a Data Engineer role at Saela. In a continued effort to increase my skill-set and utility I also started a SOC Analyst Intern role for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.
