    <p>I work at Docker as a Customer Success Manager. I have a background as a data engineer. I'm married and we have a Norwegian Elkhound/German Shepherd named Goose. I have a BA in Russian and I'm pursuing a BS in Applied Tech.</p>
    <p>I have been a life-long member of The Church of Jesus Christ. I served a mission in Russia and Kazakhstan. My favorite scripture right now is Exodus 14:14.</p>
    <p>In my spare time I am usually working on a coding project, watching movies with my wife, or playing some type of a game.</p>
