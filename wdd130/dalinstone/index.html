                <h2>Hi, I'm Dalin!</h2>
                <h3>
                    I am a Data professional working with company wide data, mastering new technologies, and growing my skillset.  
                </h3>
                <h4>
                    Using a new found love for the Russian language, I took massive action in owning my learning and following my passion for technology. 
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Entering the workforce, I jumped into a Security Analyst role at Abnormal Security. I quickly came up to speed on remediating email attacks and began to dissect the Cybersecurity AI industry. At the heart of this ground breaking technology was data. I began developing my data coding skills, beginning with SQL and eventually transitioning into Python. This role led me down a path where I would be able to use, interact with, and analyze data. After starting a Quality Assurance role at Abnormal Security, I quickly moved into a Senior Analyst role at Goldman Sachs, and sought out more opportunities to get closer to data in a Data Engineer role at Saela. In a continued effort to increase my skill-set and utility I also started a SOC Analyst Intern role for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Having progressed through those roles, I pivoted into sales at Docker where I started as a Business Development Representative, promoted to Senior Business Development Representative, moved into a closing role as an Account Executive, and then transitioned into the Customer Success department as a Customer Success Manager.
