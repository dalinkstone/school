    <p>I work as a Data Engineer. I'm married and we have a Norwegian Elkhound/German Shepherd named Goose. I have a BA in Russian and I'm pursuing a BS in Applied Tech.</p>
    <p>I started programming when I was about 13. I've used HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Java, Python, and I'm currently messing around with Golang.</p>
    <p>I have been a life-long member of The Church of Jesus Christ. I served a mission in Russia and Kazakhstan. My favorite scripture right now is Exodus 14:14.</p>
    <p>In my spare time I am usually working on a coding project, watching movies with my wife, or playing some type of a game. Right now I'm working on a project that uses a video game API to get data and compare it to a players character.</p>
    <p>I'm not a front-end wizard, but I know a bit. If you ever have any questions, whatever they might be, feel free to message me and I'll make time to help out.</p>
